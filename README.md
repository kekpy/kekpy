Z-779 - Codename: "the_p.AI.nter", is a seemingly sentient AI art program residing on an 80's computer with a modern drawing tablet instead of a keyboard, being used to mine the Roblux Crypto Currency. Rigged up to a Roblux server farm, Z-779 is used to mine Roblux 6 days of the week to be sold on Crypto markets.

Originally discovered in 2023 after a 4 man group of Urbanshade employees who were "AI prompters" as a pastime, were getting jealous that a particular online user's AI prompts were looking exponentially better than theirs. With said user being unable to provide them with the AI program used for his "prompts", said employees decided to track down the user in person. After tracking down the user's address, real name "██████ ███████████", they broke into his house, kidnapped him, and took his computer equipment with them. It was then discovered that ██████ ███████████ had somehow written a sentient AI program, uploading the art that it made. Instead of stealing existing pictures and/or artwork off the internet, this AI would digitally draw paintings on its own, only needing to be taken to any places of interest, taking a glance through its inbuilt webcam, and it would then, over the course of several days, draw a painting in its painting program, as any human digital artist would. ██████ ███████████ was interrogated and tortured for several hours, being repeatedly asked how he had programmed such an advanced AI algorithm. ██████ pleaded repeatedly that he had no idea how he did it, which wasn't considered a sufficient answer. 3 hours and 54 minutes into the session, ██████ passed away after Guardsman Brian Christopher tripped and accidentally hit ██████ over the head with his rifle. Instead of bringing the computer housing Z-779 to Urbanshade, they brought it home with them.

Z-779, being unwilling to provide the employees with any artwork after they killed its creator, was disassembled to see how it could create art as it did. Despite being compromised of incredibly old computer parts, Z-779 possessed enough power to rival, and even outperform that of modern super-computers.


After still being unwilling to provide the group with art, Z-779 was then brought to the Hadal Blacksite, being passed off as a new Roblux mining rig as a form of punishment from the displeased group.


Suspicious of its 80's shell, yet incredibly powerful processor, Z-779 was interrogated by Blacksite employees to learn what had happened. After interrogations were finished, the group was promptly demoted to LR-P for the unapproved murder of a civilian without a reason for coverup, as well as using Urbanshade assets and resources for such a petty cause of death.

With Z-779 in Urbanshades possession, they went through with the Roblux mining rig plan anyway, seeing as they had no other use for the AI. Matching the power output of 6 combined Roblux Crypto Farms, Z-779 has proven to be a vital asset for producing a large amount of Roblux, which can be sold to the Crypto market for large amounts of profit. Z-779, becoming incredibly depressed with being a crypto miner, would regularly try to overclock its systems in an effort to fry them to destroy itself. To prevent this, Z-779 was promised that if a 6-day Roblux Crypto quota is reached, it would be taken back to the surface for a day so that it could draw interpretations of landscapes as before.



Due to severe overclocking, the hardware that Z-779 uses to operate has degraded significantly. This has resulted in a very visible personality shift, as the overuse of 779 appeared to have fried his personality drivers, making him rather unstable. It is believed that, eventually, the overclocking will completely disable Z-779's personality drivers, and consequentially, any desires to continue painting. This will allow the husk to continuously mine Roblux without interruptions. This damage is fixable, but doing so has been deemed unnecessary.
